# Qooxdoo Remote Incubator

This incubator contains a proposal to add remote object synchronization to Qooxdoo; it's cross platform and
is based on the [Qooxdoo Persistence Incubator](https://github.com/qooxdoo/incubator.qx.io.persistence)

This module should be considered **ALPHA RELEASE** and is subject to change without notice.
